# Gesture-Based-Assignment

## Requirements

+ An application with a Natural User Interface is required, i.e. controlled by natural means - body movements, vocal commands, etc.
+ The minimum expectations for this NUI app would be a locally run implementation.
+ Any programming language can be used.
+ Each project should be developed by teams of two.

## Planning

Upon hearing the specifications of the project, we quickly formulated an idea to build a buzz wire game. This childhood game, very familiar to most, seemed like a ideal application to be controlled by gestures, as opposed to a feigned, impractical buzz wire game controlled by keyboard or mouse controls.

Now we had settled the orientation of our app, we needed to brainstorm and figure out how to implement the application. After considering using Myo armbands(supplied by the college) and camera motion tracking(with coloured finger tips), we decided to take advantage of the Myo armbands. The Myo armbands come equipped with both an accelerometer and a gyroscope. They also have prebuilt gestures which could come in handy if adding any additional features. Myo armbands are compatible with mulitiple languages including C# and JavaScript, which were particularly interested in.
