# Gesture-Based UI Project (60%) 2018
*A JavaScript Buzz Wire game with a gesture controlled UI, using a Myo armband and a Python backend. Developed as part of Fourth Year Software Development module Gesture Based UI.*

### Requirements
Develop an application with a Natural User Interface(NUI), i.e. controlled by natural means - body movements, vocal commands, etc.
+ The minimum expectations for this NUI app would be a locally run implementation.
+ Any programming language can be used.
+ Each project should be developed by teams of two.
+ This task is worth 60% of the overall grade and is to be completed, in teams of two, by the 9th of April.

## Introduction
Upon hearing the specifications of the project, we quickly formulated an idea to build a buzz wire game. This childhood game, very familiar to most, seemed like a ideal application to be controlled by gestures, as opposed to a feigned, impractical buzz wire game controlled by keyboard or mouse controls. With a broad idea as to what the end result of this project should be, we began brainstorming the actual implementation.

We considered two possible hardware solutions for our project -  
+ Motion tracking using a camera and coloured finger tips, using [trackingjs](https://trackingjs.com/)  
+ Electromyographic sensor based gesture recognition, using a [Myo](https://www.myo.com) armband  

After deliberating over the two technologies we decided to go with the Myo armband. We chose the Myo for a number of reasons, which we outline in the *[Hardare Used in Creating the Application](#hardware-used-in-creating-the-application)* section. We decided the best way 

Purpose of the application  
design of the application including the screens of the user interface and how it works.  The application can be an experimentation process for you, testing how pieces of hardware could interact or be combined with gestures.  You don’t have to solve the world economic crisis just yet.  

Gestures identified as appropriate for this application –  
consider how gestures can be incorporated into the application, making a justified argument for the ones that you pick.  This is a research element for the project.  

Hardware used in creating the application –  
You are not limited to the hardware listed above.  If you have your own hardware, or hardware simulator that you wish to use, then feel free.  The purpose of each piece of hardware should be given with a comparison to other options available.  
Architecture for the solution –  
the full architecture for the solution, including the class diagrams, any data models, communications and distributed elements that you are creating.  

Conclusions & Recommendations –  
Conclusions are what you have learned from this project and the associated research.  Recommendations are what you would do differently if you were to undertake the project again.  The Reflective Piece – what I learned and “enjoyed”
